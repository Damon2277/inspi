### 5. ComplianceChecker
**Location**: `src/lib/testing/quality-gates/ComplianceChecker.ts`

**Features**:
- Code quality standards enforcement
- Documentation requirements verification
- Naming convention compliance checking
- Error handling best practices validation
- TypeScript usage compliance

**Compliance Categories**:
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for functions and test suites
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase variables, descriptive test names
- **Error Handling**: try-catch blocks, promise error handling
- **TypeScript**: Type annotations, avoiding 'any' type
- **Testing**: Test assertions, proper test structure

## Quality Gate Configuration

### Default Thresholds
```typescript
{
  coverage: {
    statements: 90%,
    branches: 85%,
    functions: 90%,
    lines: 90%
  },
  performance: {
    maxRegressionPercent: 20%,
    maxExecutionTime: 60000ms,
    maxMemoryUsage: 512MB
  },
  security: {
    failOnViolation: true,
    allSecurityRules: enabled
  },
  compliance: {
    failOnViolation: false,
    allComplianceRules: enabled
  }
}
```

### Configurable Options
- **Coverage**: Thresholds, exclude patterns, fail conditions
- **Performance**: Regression limits, baseline files, tracking options
- **Security**: Rule enabling/disabling, custom rules, severity levels
- **Compliance**: Rule categories, severity levels, custom rules

## Quality Scoring System

### Score Calculation
- **Coverage Score** (30% weight): Based on average coverage percentages
- **Performance Score** (25% weight): Based on regression analysis
- **Security Score** (25% weight): Based on violation severity and count
- **Compliance Score** (20% weight): Based on rule violations

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical**: Immediate action required (critical security issues)
- **High**: Should be addressed before deployment
- **Medium**: Should be addressed in next iteration
- **Low**: Minor issues, can be addressed over time

## Integration Points

### CI/CD Integration
```typescript
const qualityGate = new QualityGateSystem(config);
const result = await qualityGate.executeQualityGate(testResults);

if (!result.passed) {
  console.error('Quality gate failed:', result.blockers);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Custom Rules
```typescript
// Add custom security rule
qualityGate.addCustomSecurityRule({
  id: 'custom-rule',
  pattern: /dangerous-pattern/g,
  severity: 'high',
  recommendation: 'Use safer alternative'
});

// Add custom compliance rule
qualityGate.addCustomComplianceRule({
  id: 'custom-compliance',
  check: (file, content) => violations,
  category: 'documentation'
});
```

## Reporting Features

### Comprehensive Reports
- **Executive Summary**: Pass/fail status, overall score, key metrics
- **Detailed Analysis**: Category-specific violations and recommendations
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical comparison and regression detection
- **Actionable Insights**: Prioritized recommendations for improvement

### Report Formats
- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports for documentation
- **JSON**: Machine-readable for integration and processing
- **Console**: Real-time feedback during development

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
const qualityGate = new QualityGateSystem();
const result = await qualityGate.executeQualityGate();

console.log(`Quality Score: ${result.overallScore}/100`);
console.log(`Status: ${result.passed ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED'}`);

if (!result.passed) {
  console.log('Blockers:', result.blockers);
}
```

### Advanced Configuration
```typescript
const qualityGate = new QualityGateSystem({
  coverage: {
    thresholds: { statements: 95, branches: 90, functions: 95, lines: 95 },
    failOnThreshold: true
  },
  security: {
    rules: { noHardcodedSecrets: true, noSqlInjection: true },
    failOnViolation: true
  },
  performance: {
    thresholds: { maxRegressionPercent: 10 },
    failOnRegression: true
  }
});
```
