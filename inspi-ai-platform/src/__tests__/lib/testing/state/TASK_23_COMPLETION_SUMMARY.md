  actions: [
    {
      name: 'Increment',
      type: 'sync',
      execute: (store) => store.setState({ count: store.getState().count + 1 })
    }

    {
      name: 'Count incremented',
      type: 'state',
      check: (store) => store.getState().count === 1

const results = await framework.runTests(scenarios);
```

### Zustand Store Testing
```typescript
import { ZustandTestUtils } from '@/lib/testing/state';

const store = ZustandTestUtils.builder()
  .withInitialState({ count: 0 })
  .withActions({
    increment: (state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })
  })
  .build();

const scenarios = ZustandTestUtils.createCommonScenarios(store, { count: 0 });
```

### Consistency Testing
```typescript
import { createConsistencyTester, createDefaultConsistencyConfig } from '@/lib/testing/state';

const tester = createConsistencyTester(createDefaultConsistencyConfig());

tester.registerInvariant({
  name: 'Count Non-Negative',
  check: (state) => state.count >= 0,
  severity: 'high',
  message: 'Count cannot be negative'
