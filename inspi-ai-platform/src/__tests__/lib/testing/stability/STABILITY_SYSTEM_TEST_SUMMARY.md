- Optional persistence to localStorage

**Key Metrics**:
- Flakiness score (0-1 scale)
- Pass/fail/skip counts
- Average duration and variance

- Actionable recommendations for each pattern type

**Pattern Types**:
- **Intermittent**: Alternating pass/fail patterns
- **Timing**: High duration variance and timing-related failures
- **Environmental**: Different behavior in CI vs local environments

- Error categorization and retry decision logic
- Skip patterns for non-retryable errors (syntax errors, etc.)
- Retry statistics and success rate tracking

**Retry Strategies**:
- Default strategy for stable tests (2 retries)
- Medium flakiness strategy (3 retries with moderate backoff)
- High flakiness strategy (5 retries with jitter)
- Custom strategies for specific error types

### 4. TestEnvironmentVerifier
**Location**: `src/lib/testing/stability/TestEnvironmentVerifier.ts`

**Features**:
- Environment snapshot capture (Node.js version, platform, memory, CPU, etc.)
- Baseline comparison and consistency verification
- Difference categorization (critical/warning/info)
- Environment setup script generation
- Consistency history tracking and trend analysis

**Verification Areas**:
- Node.js version and platform
- System resources (memory, CPU)
- Environment variables
